# CryptographyWithPython
Here I am posting cryptographic ciphers as well as BruteForce.      
List of scramblers:     
- FromBinaryToDecimal     
- MorseCode     
      
- FromBinaryToDecimal -     
  This encoder converts binary to decimal.

- MorseCode -     
  This encoder translates characters from Morse code into Latin characters and numbers and vice versa.

When encoding from Morse code into Latin letters, do not forget to put three spaces at the end, the program does not display the last letter if it is not done.
